#Thomas' CSS Show and Tell

###Animation

Since I have some previous experience with CSS, for my show and tell, I decided to try my hand at something new: animation. All I attempted to do here was change the color and rotation of three concentric divs. They are set at different speeds, and the middle box rotates in the opposite direction.

I used the W3C's Tutorial on CSS animation, here:
